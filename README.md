# LinkedIn Profile API (Workaround)

This repository exposes my **LinkedIn profile data** in JSON format so that my **portfolio** can consume it as an API via **GitHub Raw**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

LinkedIn does not provide a public API for personal profile data anymore.  
This repository works as a simple and compliant workaround â€” hosting my professional experience, education, and skills in a JSON file that can be accessed like an API.

## ðŸ“¦ Example

You can fetch my data directly from the raw file:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>/main/resume.json
